########\n","\n","#The comparison between Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier indicates that the Random Forest Classifier performed slightly better than the Logistic Regression model in terms of accuracy and overall predictive capability.\n","#The confusion matrix for the Random Forest Classifier shows that it was able to correctly identify more buy and sell signals, with precision values of 0.54 for buy signals (1) and 0.49 for sell signals (-1). The recall for Random Forest was 0.58 for buy signals (1) and 0.46 for sell signals (-1). This leads to F1-scores of 0.56 for buy signals (1) and 0.47 for sell signals (-1).\n","#In contrast, the Logistic Regression model exhibited higher precision for sell signals (-1) at 0.75 but struggled significantly with recall, achieving only 0.02, which suggests it was less effective at identifying sell signals compared to Random Forest.\n","#This performance suggests that while Logistic Regression may excel in precision for certain predictions, the Random Forest algorithm, which captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features, is better suited for predicting buy/sell signals based on historical stock prices.\n","#The implementation of this trading strategy using Random Forest can potentially aid in decision-making for stock purchases and improve overall trading performance.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3DaRiArRSIOe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
